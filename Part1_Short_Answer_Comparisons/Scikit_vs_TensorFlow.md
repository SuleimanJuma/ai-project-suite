# Comparative Analysis: Scikit-learn vs TensorFlow

---

### 1. Target Applications

- **Scikit-learn**: Best suited for classical ML tasks like regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction (e.g., SVMs, decision trees, random forests).
- **TensorFlow**: Built for deep learning tasks like image classification, NLP, time series forecasting, etc., using neural networks and GPUs.

---

### 2. Ease of Use for Beginners

- **Scikit-learn**: Very beginner-friendly. Simple, consistent API (`fit`, `predict`, `score`) across models. Ideal for those starting in ML.
- **TensorFlow**: Steeper learning curve due to more complex concepts (tensors, sessions, graph execution), but `tf.keras` helps bridge this.

---

### 3. Community Support

- **Scikit-learn**: Strong community for traditional ML, extensive documentation, lots of examples.
- **TensorFlow**: Larger ecosystem and support, especially for deep learning. Tons of tutorials, model hubs, and tools like TensorBoard.
