# üß† Ethical Considerations: Bias Analysis in AI Models

## 1. Bias in the MNIST Model

While MNIST is a relatively balanced dataset, biases can still arise:

- **Digit Confusion Bias**: Some digits like 1 and 7, or 5 and 3, are visually similar. If the training data contains uneven samples or poor-quality examples, the model may underperform on these classes.
- **Handwriting Style Bias**: If most samples come from specific writing styles (e.g., Western handwriting), the model might not generalize well to other cultural styles.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Mitigation Strategies:
- **Data Augmentation**: Introduce rotated, skewed, or scaled digits to simulate various handwriting styles.
- **Fairness Indicators**: Use tools like **TensorFlow Fairness Indicators** to measure model performance across subgroups (if available).

## 2. Bias in Amazon Reviews (NLP)

**Potential bias** examples:
- Reviews may reflect gender or cultural stereotypes.
- Sarcasm and figurative language may skew sentiment analysis.

### üõ† spaCy Mitigation Tools:
- **Rule-based Pipelines**: Custom sentiment rules can reduce overfitting to misleading words (e.g., "This is *sick!*" may be positive in slang).
- **Entity Filtering**: Filter only relevant named entities like *brands* or *products* to avoid irrelevant emotional cues.

### ‚úÖ General Best Practices:
- Audit models regularly for demographic fairness.
- Use explainability tools to interpret model predictions.
