"# Ethics and Debugging" 
# 📄 README: Bias Analysis in AI Models

Welcome to the **Bias Analysis Documentation**. This file—[`bias_analysis.md`](./bias_analysis.md)—serves as a comprehensive exploration of ethical concerns related to **bias in AI models**, specifically focusing on two widely-used datasets: **MNIST** for image classification and **Amazon Reviews** for Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## 🧠 What’s Inside

The `bias_analysis.md` document outlines **how unintended biases** can appear in AI models, even when trained on widely accepted datasets. It also discusses **practical mitigation strategies** and tools to help data scientists create **fairer, more inclusive models**.

### 🔍 Covered Topics:

#### 1. **Bias in the MNIST Model**
- **Issues Identified**:
  - *Digit Confusion*: Misclassification due to visually similar digits.
  - *Handwriting Style Bias*: Overfitting to Western handwriting patterns.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Data augmentation to introduce variety.
  - Use of fairness metrics if subgroup labels are available.

#### 2. **Bias in Amazon Reviews (NLP)**
- **Issues Identified**:
  - Reviews reflecting societal or cultural stereotypes.
  - Challenges with sarcasm and informal expressions.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Rule-based sentiment tuning with spaCy.
  - Entity filtering to reduce irrelevant emotional noise.

## ⚖️ Why This Matters

Understanding and addressing **bias in AI models** is essential for:
- Building **trustworthy** and **transparent** systems.
- Meeting **ethical and legal obligations**.
- Ensuring **equitable treatment** across demographic or cultural groups.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Mentioned

- **TensorFlow Fairness Indicators** – For monitoring and evaluating fairness metrics.
- **spaCy** – For NLP tasks like entity recognition and rule-based pipelines.
- **Explainability Tools** – To audit and understand model behavior.

## 🚀 How to Use This Document

This analysis is especially helpful for:
- **Data scientists** performing model evaluations.
- **Ethics teams** auditing fairness practices.
- **ML engineers** implementing bias mitigation during model training.

Feel free to expand or adapt the analysis to your specific dataset and use case.
